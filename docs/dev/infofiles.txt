Infofiles

Infofiles document your file / layout colocating them with the files they annotate. 

1. Syntax

    Infofiles are , by default named ".info", line based (1 line per file / dir) and the format couldn't be simpler: 
    One item per line: 
        <path> <annotation>
    (info)
    
    The format is design to be very permissive as it tends to be hand written:
    - If path contains a space, it has to be escaped, the first space marks the annotation start.
    i Pounds as the first char ar comments and ignored when parsing
    # This is a comment
    - Blank lines are cool and  spaces at the beginning and end of lines are trimmed.
    - A line with only one item is ignored. (path)


2. Semantics

    As info files are informational and not transactional the info system will not raise errors (i.e. halt execution), but instead emit warnings when needed. These include: 

    - Path  does not exist
    - Path is not contained in the .info file path (i.e. points to the .info directory's parent)
