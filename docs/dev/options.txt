File Tree Filtering Options


These are the search options we plan to implement. 
Note that these should be regular objects at this point, the cli connection
comes later, but these are listed as flags for clarity.

Search: 
    Terms for search in file path and name 

Tree Options: 
    -l --level Max depth of the fs to traverse.(default: 3)
    -d --directory : show directories only
    -e --excludes : a pattern to exclude (can be used multiple times)
    -h --hidden : show hidden files (those starting with ., default: true)

    -ignorefile-path Changes the path to the ignore file (default: .gitignore)
    -ignorefile-no: Do not honor ignore files 

Info Plugin (later)
    -a --annotated: show annotated files only
    -n --non-annotated: show not annotated files only

Git Plugin (Later)
    -m --modified : show only files modified (by git)
    -s --staged : show only staged files (by git)
