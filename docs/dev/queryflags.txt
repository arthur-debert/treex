Query Flags for Treex

treex will support a rich query language tailored to a shell invokation. 


$ treex --ignorefiles-no  --query --size-gte=3MB --modified-date-lt=1week

Lets break this down. 
The --query flag "splits" the queries session of the command. From that point on, only queries are expected. 

A query has the form: 

--<attribute>-operator=input

That is , the equality query must be -eq operator, for exmaple.

We will use humanize to parse non numerical values for date/times., size, etc.


Implementation: 

1. The query option syntax doesn't play well with vi
